> It's a great little app build mainly to practice my Babel & Webpack configuration skills. It uses json-server to act as a fake rest API, Bootstrap theme, and IMHO a solid HTML, CSS, and JS implementations.

> #### Usage: 
> After downloading (cloning) this repo, all you have to do is run `npm i` inside of the root folder, after that just run the following command `npm run dev` - This will start the json-server, `nodemon`, and make a file inside of the `build` folder. That's it. Now, all you have to do is open `localhost:8080`, or even better use an extension like `Live Server` (VS Code) and it will open it in your browser, or just open the `index.html` :) There is a local JSON file with 5x posts to start experiment with, but you can add new ones, delete and edit them.

> #### Additional info: It also uses  my very own "BiggaHTTP Library" -> A simple library for making HTTP requests.
